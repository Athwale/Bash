Linux mint modifications (applicable to most ubuntu based systems)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Install firewall 
  sudo apt-get install gufw
- Set firewall rules from backup
- Inside firewall set IN deny, OUT allow
- Turn off logging in gufw settings (saves disk writes on some devices RPi) 

- Modify /etc/passwd
  sudo nano /etc/passwd
- Disable shell for account except root, speechdispatcher, libuuid and your user
- Set the rest to /bin/false 
- Prevents potential attacker from logging in
  
- Lock accounts in /etc/shadow excet yours (passwd -l účet).
  Locked accounts keep passwords but logging in with password is not possible. Even root can be locked, we use sudo.

  ! locked
  * without password, login not possible, can not be enabled (passwd -u account).

- Example:  
  root:!$6$Q...:7:::
  daemon:!*:15819:0:99999:7:::
  sync:!*:15819:0:99999:7:::
  ...
  alena:$6$v...:7:::

- OBSOLETE
- Turns on numlock on login screen
- sudo apt-get install numlockx
  
- Add errors=remount-ro,noatime to root disk in fstab, prevents writing last access time onto disk, faster disk use.
  
- Edit sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf change packet behavior as needed.
- Install sudo apt-get install preload (faster program launch)
- Install chkrootkit and rkhunter
  Run:
  rkhunter --update
  rkhunter --check
  chkrootkit
  
- Set login screen to Simple Greeter (from backup)
- Remove desktop icons (desktop settings in Menu)
- Set window manager to macro (because of appearance of icons and desktops settings)
- Turn off screensaver + others in power management settings.
- Install OTR for pidgin (http://community.linuxmint.com/software/view/pidgin-otr)
- Turn off pidgin popup notifications (pidgin plugins)
- Install freefilesync (File sync for NAS)
- Install fslint (duplicate file search)
- Install nmap
- Install vnc4server and openssh-server
- Install youtube-dl and libav-tools for mp3 conversion
- Set Alt+Shift for keyboard layout switch (Keyboard - Layouts - Options)
- Install apparmor, apparmor-profiles, apparmor-notify
- Add theme absolute from backup
- Set keyboard shotcutsd for screen switching (Keyboard shortcuts)
- Turn off Recenly used - replace file /home/$USER/.local/share/recently-used.xbel with a folder
- Download TOR
- Turn off automatic disku action after mount (Menu - File management - Media) 
- Replace .thumbnail and ./cache/thumbnails with a link to /dev/null in Home/$USER
	su root
	rm -rf .thumbnails/
	ln -s /dev/null /home/$USER/.thumbnails
	
- If the sound output is messy kill pulseaudio (pulseaudio --kill) before that some sound has to be played.

- Install dnscrypt-proxy (DNS request encryption).
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:anton+/dnscrypt
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install dnscrypt-proxy

  After all steps: Set DNS Servers in network manager to 127.0.0.1 
  Set automatic DHCP addresses only, and IPv6 set to Ignore
  Set up dnsctypt:
 
  sudo systemctl edit --full dnscrypt-proxy.socket
  Set: 
  [Socket]
  ListenStream=127.0.0.2:5356 
  ListenDatagram=127.0.0.2:5356
  Port 53 needs root access, 5356 does not
  --full does not create additional .d folders in /etc/systemd/system and
  directly edits the whole config file.

  Change resolver in:
  sudo systemctl edit -full dnscrypt-proxy.service
  Set:
  [Service]
  Environment="DNSCRYPT_PROXY_RESOLVER_NAME1=dnscrypt.eu-dk"
  Set the same resolver in sudo nano /etc/default/dnscrypt-proxy
  
  Lock _dnscrypt-proxy in shadow
  
  Set up dnsmasq to use dnscrypt on port 5356 and to listen on 127.0.0.1
  sudo apt-get install dnsmasq (dnsmasq may not be fully installed) We are using
  it as our local resolver.
  In sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf paste this:
  # Don't read the hostnames in /etc/hosts.
  no-hosts

  # Do not provide DHCP or TFTP on the loopback interface.
  no-dhcp-interface=lo

  # Only listen on the loopback interface.
  listen-address=127.0.0.1

  # Only bind to interfaces dnsmasq is listening on.
  bind-interfaces

  # Never forward addresses in the non-routed address spaces.
  bogus-priv

  # Don't read /etc/resolv.conf.
  no-resolv

  # Reject (and log) addresses from upstream nameservers which are in
  # the private IP ranges. This blocks an attack where a browser behind
  # a firewall is used to probe machines on the local network.
  stop-dns-rebind

  # Exempt 127.0.0.0/8 from rebinding checks. This address range is
  # returned by realtime black hole servers, so blocking it may disable
  # these services.
  rebind-localhost-ok

  # Never forward plain names (without a dot or domain part).
  domain-needed

  # Upstream server is dnscrypt-proxy on local machine.
  server=127.0.0.2#5356

  # Set the cache size here. If you don't use spam blocking add-ons such
  # Adblock Plus or Ghostery, you may want to increase this value as you
  # will be resolving more domain names.
  cache-size=1000

  # Pass through DNSSEC validation results from dnscrypt-proxy.
  proxy-dnssec

  Set up NetworkManager to NOT use dnsmasq:
  sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
  dns change to #dns=dnsmasq
  This prevents spawning two dnsmasq instances in the system.
  Disable ofono in the same file, useless too

  Set 127.0.0.1 into sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
  (Changes in this file immediately affect the system)
  If net does not work set 8.8.8.8 in this file

  Start dnscrypt service:
  sudo killall dnsmasq (otherwise may cause BIND error)
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl enable dnscrypt-proxy.service
  sudo systemctl enable dnscrypt-proxy.socket
  sudo systemctl enable dnscrypt-proxy
  sudo systemctl start dnscrypt-proxy
  sudo systemctl start dnsmasq

  Check status by:
  sudo systemctl status dnscrypt-proxy
  sudo systemctl status dnsmasq
  dnscrypt-proxy
  
  If dnscrypt-proxy can not retrieve server certificates, try using different
  resolver from:
  libreoffice /usr/share/dnscrypt-proxy/dnscrypt-resolvers.csv
  
  Check successful instalation on https://dnsleaktest.com/
